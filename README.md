# penxyls
Like a pen. Like some pixels. Like a thingr. Maybe the greatest thingr ever. Also sass maps.

## Things to do

- [ ] Optimise Sass loop to skip transparent boxes
- [ ] Update image scanner to output the box-shadow in css ready format
- [ ] Evaluate using CSS vars as colors and sizes eg. ```box-shadow: 1em 1em a, 1em 2em a;```
- [ ] Update gulp to use [brotli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-brotli)
- [ ] Compile separate stylesheets for each image
- [ ] look to see if php can take any of the computing load from gulp
